<h1>Hi, I'm Bhavya! <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/bhavyasingh1409">Economist</a>, 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavya-singh-709505205/">Strategy & Research</a>, 
<a href="mailto:bhavyasingh1409@gmail.com">Mixed-Methods</a></h1>

<p>I work at the intersection of <b>economics, data, and decision-making</b>.  
My goal is to turn complex problems—whether in <i>public policy</i>, <i>financial markets</i>, or <i>emerging ventures</i>—into clear, evidence-based insights.  
From evaluating government labour programmes, to modelling pension reforms, to studying volatility in oil markets, I build research that is rigorous, practical, and usable by <b>policymakers, investors, and founders alike</b>.</p>

<h2>📊 Featured Research Projects:</h2>

- <b>Pension Spending, Ageing, and Policy Choices (UK & Japan)</b>  
  - <a href="https://github.com/bhavyasingh1409/pensions-ageing">Independent econometric decomposition</a> of public pension spending (2000–2023) using OECD SOCX data.  
  - <i>Finding:</i> Demography is not destiny — deliberate policy choices can counterbalance ageing pressures.  
  - <i>Skills:</i> Economic Modelling · Time Series Analysis · Decomposition Methods · R Dashboards  

- <b>Oil Markets under a Second Trump Presidency</b>  
  - <a href="https://github.com/bhavyasingh1409/oil-trump-analysis">Event-based datasets & analysis</a> of Brent & WTI (2015–2025).  
  - Examined supply/demand shifts, volatility, Brent–WTI spreads, and links to VIX.  
  - <i>Finding:</i> Trump-era policies drive volatility premiums — WTI reacts more strongly, Brent remains stable.  
  - <i>Skills:</i> Energy Markets · Risk & Uncertainty · Event Studies · Volatility Modelling  

- <b>MSc Dissertation: Evaluating JEEViKA’s Impact on Financial Inclusion in Bihar, India</b>  
  - Conducted an econometric study using the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to test whether JEEViKA, a large-scale rural livelihoods programme, improved access to financial services (2004–2022).  
  - <i>Finding:</i> No significant causal impact; results reveal implementation barriers (informal finance distortions, rent-seeking politics, persistent gender/caste norms).  
  - <i>Implication:</i> Bottom-up programmes need strong institutions and inclusive governance to succeed.  
  - <i>Skills:</i> Causal Inference · Econometrics · R (tidyverse, synth) · Statistical Data Analysis · Report Writing
