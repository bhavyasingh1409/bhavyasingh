# Hi, I'm Bhavya! 👋  
**Economist · Strategy & Research · Mixed-Methods**  

I work at the intersection of **economics, data, and decision-making**.  
My goal is to turn complex problems, whether in *public policy*, *financial markets*, or *emerging ventures* into clear, evidence-based insights.  
From evaluating government labour programmes, to modelling pension reforms, to studying volatility in oil markets, I build research that is rigorous, practical, and usable by **policymakers, investors, and founders alike**.

## 📊 Featured Research Projects

### [Oil Markets under a Second Trump Presidency](https://github.com/bhavyasingh1409/oil-markets-brent-wti/blob/main/README.md)  
- Analysis of Brent & WTI crude oil prices (2015–2025) using event-based methods.  
- Looked at price trends, the Brent–WTI spread, short-term volatility, and how oil reacts to financial market risk (VIX).  
- **Findings:**  
  - Trump’s first term saw very high volatility, including the 2020 oil price crash, showing that policy uncertainty can make markets less stable.  
  - WTI prices respond more strongly to U.S. policy moves (tariffs, reserves, sanctions), while Brent remains the more stable global benchmark.  
  - Oil markets move more closely with financial market risk during turbulent times, meaning a second Trump term could increase this connection.   
- **Skills:** Energy Markets · Risk & Uncertainty · Event Studies · Volatility & Beta Modelling

### [Pension Spending, Ageing, and Policy Choices (UK & Japan)](https://github.com/bhavyasingh1409/pension_analysis/blob/main/README.md)
- Independent econometric decomposition of public pension spending (2000–2023) using OECD SOCX data.  
- **Finding:** Demography is not destiny — deliberate policy choices can counterbalance ageing pressures.  
- **Skills:** Economic Modelling · Time Series Analysis · Decomposition Methods · R Dashboards

### MSc Dissertation: Evaluating JEEViKA’s Impact on Financial Inclusion in Bihar, India (LSE)  
- Econometric study using the **Synthetic Control Method (SCM)** to test if JEEViKA improved financial inclusion (2004–2022).  
- **Finding:** No significant causal impact; results reveal implementation barriers (informal finance distortions, rent-seeking politics, persistent gender/caste norms).  
- **Implication:** Bottom-up programmes need strong institutions and inclusive governance to succeed.  
- **Skills:** Causal Inference · Econometrics · R (tidyverse, synth) · Statistical Data Analysis · Report Writing
